EdgeSync Multi-Tenant IoT Platform:

**Unleash Unlimited Scale for IoT Developers and Businesses**

Roboworks Automation's EdgeSync is a cloud-based IoT platform for Data and Device Management, featuring cloud-based MQTT broker management. It's not just another IoT platform; EdgeSync empowers you to Sync, Visualize, and Act on your data in real-time autonomously by running workflows on your devices.

**Comprehensive IoT Project Delivery**

EdgeSync offers everything needed to quickly deliver IoT projects, including:

* Edge Device registration  
* Edge data logging  
* Edge analytics  
* EdgeBoard designer  
* Over-the-air updates  
* Natural Language automation agentic Integration

**Secure and Reliable IoT Management**

Companies large and small rely on Roboworks Automation for secure and reliable IoT management solutions, built on state-of-the-art IoT Technologies like MQTT, SQL/NoSQL DBMS, and proven ACL design patterns. EdgeSync provides a complete IoT Multi-Tenant management solution, empowering you to create IoT projects faster, more securely, and with optimal cost.

**Enhanced Edge Devices**

Our Edge Devices offer scalability, communication, and device data storage capabilities comparable to Industrial PLCs, with added features such as:

* EdgeBoard view portal  
* Edge agent  
* Edge data management service  
* Edge analytics  
* Over-the-air updates

**EdgeBoard Design Viewer**

The EdgeBoard Viewer web application accelerates and streamlines the creation and setup of comprehensive cloud and storage, securely integrating dozens of devices within minutes. It offers HTTP/HTTPS, MQTT, and WebSocket polling options.

**IoT Edge Analytics**

Each view in EdgeBoard Viewer provides extensive device metrics and analytics to visualize device data via a suite of graphical widgets. Connect widgets to Industrial Loggers for instant actions to manage devices.

**Advanced Analytics**

Write SQL queries on your database using tenant-specific schemas and host dashboards for your users with templates.

**Low Code IoT Dashboard Designer**

The EdgeBoard view is a low-code web application with fully customizable IoT device management apps. Visually create any dashboard with your logo, product name, color, and font theme, device data, and device-specific UI pages for compelling mobile or desktop apps. Business logic can be written in IL and ST languages.

**IoT Over-the-Air Updates**

Keep devices current with over-the-air updates. EdgeSync's OTA update manager manages software updates to the entire device fleet and selectively deploys updates to desired subsets. (Currently supports esp32 platform only.)

**Complete IoT Solution**

Focus on your product while EdgeSync handles IoT device management. Rather than integrating dozens of Edge services and building a custom backend, rely on Roboworks Automation's EdgeSync solution. EdgeSync configures the cloud service with MQTT broker, data plane, security, and device management, reducing risk and freeing you from non-core IoT tasks, saving up to 70% of IoT design time.

**Provisioned Cloud MQTT Broker**

With EdgeSync's paid plan, provision a MQTT v3.1, v3.1.1, or v5.0 broker cloud instance for secure IoT device management. The platform configures and integrates Access Control services, creating a sophisticated IoT cloud. The MQTT cloud is created and managed according to best security practices, using TLS/SSL encryption with authentication, saving up to 80% of IoT implementation time.

**Simplify and Accelerate Your Journey**

EdgeSync provides a visual low-code device app designer to create stunning dashboards for remote device management. Customize app logos, device data, and UI pages without coding, accelerating IoT delivery time by up to 5x. Alternatively, create your own API hooks service using EdgeSync APIs for ultimate control. Automate numerous key steps in your IoT journey:

* Creating device clouds  
* Managing device communications  
* Routing and storing device data  
* Computing metrics  
* Delivering over-the-air updates  
* Monitoring and managing the user base  
* Create and assign multiple projects to multiple users with remote data control, including OTA updates and ACLs.

**Innovative IoT Device Management Meta-platform**

EdgeSync leverages the AWS IoT platform and state-of-the-art architecture for remarkable scalability and cost efficiency, delivering comprehensive edge device management.

**Edge IoT Data**

Device data is stored in a dedicated, private AWS database in a local AWS IoT region, separate from other customer tenants' data. Data goes directly from the device to the device cloud.

**Control and Privacy**

For absolute control, host the device cloud in a dedicated AWS account for 100% privacy and control over governance, storage, and data management.

**Encrypted Communications**

All communications are encrypted end-to-end. Device data and commands never transit another service or network and are encrypted in transit and at rest.
