‚è∫ Perfect! I have successfully implemented Phase 2: Flow Engine with a comprehensive flow execution system.
  Here's what has been completed:

  ‚úÖ Phase 2 Implementation Summary

  Core Engine Components

  1. Dependency Resolver (dependency_resolver.py)

  - Topological Sorting: Uses Kahn's algorithm for optimal execution order
  - Cycle Detection: DFS-based circular dependency detection
  - Execution Levels: Groups nodes that can execute in parallel
  - Critical Path Analysis: Identifies the longest execution path
  - Parallelism Analysis: Calculates parallelization opportunities

  2. Execution Context (execution_context.py)

  - Thread-Safe State Management: Manages flow execution state
  - Node Results Storage: Stores execution results and status
  - Flow Variables: Shared variables between nodes
  - Execution Metrics: Performance tracking and timing
  - Event Logging: Comprehensive execution event logging

  3. Node Scheduler (node_scheduler.py)

  - Multiple Execution Strategies: Sequential, Parallel, and Hybrid
  - Thread Pool Management: Configurable worker threads
  - Error Handling: Graceful failure recovery
  - Event Callbacks: Real-time execution monitoring
  - Smart Parallel Detection: Automatic parallel/sequential node categorization

  4. Flow Executor (flow_executor.py)

  - Main Orchestration: Coordinates all execution components
  - Database Integration: Updates FlowExecution and NodeExecution models
  - Execution Control: Pause, resume, and stop functionality
  - Comprehensive Error Handling: Graceful failure management
  - Event System: Extensible callback system for monitoring

  Key Features Implemented

  üîÑ Dependency Resolution

  # Handles complex dependency patterns:
  - Linear flows: A ‚Üí B ‚Üí C
  - Parallel branches: A ‚Üí [B,C] ‚Üí D
  - Diamond patterns: A ‚Üí [B,C] ‚Üí D (B,C both feed D)
  - Cycle detection: Prevents infinite loops

  ‚ö° Execution Strategies

  1. Sequential: Executes one node at a time (safe, predictable)
  2. Parallel: Executes all nodes in each level simultaneously (fast)
  3. Hybrid: Smart mix - I/O operations parallel, CPU operations sequential

  üìä Real-time Monitoring

  - Node execution status tracking
  - Performance metrics and timing
  - Error propagation and handling
  - Execution event logging

  üîß Integration Points

  - API Endpoint: Updated /execute/ endpoint in flows/views.py
  - Database Models: Uses existing FlowExecution and NodeExecution
  - Processor Factory: Seamless integration with Phase 1 processors
  - WebSocket Support: Ready for real-time updates

  üìã Explanation Documentation

  Created comprehensive documentation in /flows/engine/EXECUTION_ORDER_EXPLANATION.md covering:

  - Dependency Resolution Algorithms
  - Execution Order Strategies
  - Performance Optimizations
  - Error Handling Approaches
  - Cycle Detection Methods
  - Critical Path Analysis

  üöÄ Usage Example

  # Execute a flow with hybrid strategy
  from flows.engine import FlowExecutor, ExecutionStrategy

  result = FlowExecutor.create_and_execute(
      flow_diagram=flow,
      execution_strategy=ExecutionStrategy.HYBRID,
      max_workers=4,
      trigger_data={'sensor_value': 25.6}
  )

  üì° API Integration

  The flow execution endpoint now supports:

  POST /api/flows/{uuid}/execute/
  {
      "strategy": "hybrid",        // sequential, parallel, hybrid
      "max_workers": 4,           // thread pool size
      "trigger_data": {           // optional trigger data
          "user_input": "start",
          "initial_value": 100
      }
  }

  This Phase 2 implementation provides a robust, scalable flow execution engine that can handle all the node
  types from your flow editor image, with intelligent dependency resolution, multiple execution strategies,
  and comprehensive monitoring capabilities.
